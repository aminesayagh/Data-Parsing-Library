# PHP Data Parsing Library (Zod-Like)

The Zod Data Parsing and schema declaration Library is designed to bring the robust schema definition and validation capabilities similar to those in the Zod library (JavaScript) to PHP applications. This library offers flexible, modular, and extensible data validation tools that empower developers to enforce strict data integrity rules easily and reliably.

**Current Version:** v1.0.0

**Note:** This library is currently in development. Official documentation and further resources will be available soon.

## Introduction
The Zod Data Parsing and schema declaration Library is designed to bring the robust schema definition and validation capabilities similar to those in the Zod library (JavaScript) to PHP applications. This library offers flexible, modular, and extensible data validation tools that empower developers to enforce strict data integrity rules easily and reliably.

### Some other great aspects:

- **Robust Schema Validation**: Provides strong typing and validation similar to the Zod library, ensuring accurate data handling.
- **Modular and Extensible**: Easy to extend with custom parsers, accommodating diverse data validation needs.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Keeps data parsing separate from business logic for better security and maintainability.
- **Ease of Testing**: Simplifies testing by enforcing strict data validation.
- **Flexible Configuration**: Supports dynamic parser configurations and customizations without altering the core library.
- **Community-Focused**: Open for contributions, enhancing collective improvement and support.

## Installation

**Note: The PHP Data Parsing Library is currently under active development and is not yet ready for production use.**

We appreciate your interest and encourage you to watch this space for updates. Once the library reaches a stable release, installation instructions will be provided here to help you get started with integrating it into your PHP projects.

## Usage

### Basic Parsing
Define and validate data types using simple schema definitions:
    ```php
    use function Zod\z;
    $my_schema = z()->string();
    
    $response_valid = $my_schema->parse("Hello, World!"); // Returns Zod data object
    $value = $response_valid->value; // Returns "Hello, World!"

    $response_invalid = $my_schema->parse(123); // Returns Zod data object
    $error = $response_invalid->error; // Returns a Zod error object
    ```
