# PHP Data Parsing Library (Zod-Like)

The PHP Data Parsing Library is designed to bring the robust schema definition and validation capabilities similar to those in the Zod library (JavaScript) to PHP applications. This library offers flexible, modular, and extensible data validation tools that empower developers to enforce strict data integrity rules easily and reliably.

**Current Version:** v1.0.0

**Note:** This library is currently in development. Official documentation and further resources will be available soon.
